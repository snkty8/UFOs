# UFOs

## Overview of Project 
A webpage was created to show UFO sightings in differnt areas of the US in the year 2010.  It is working fantasically, but we can only we filter the page by the date.  We have been tasked to allow multiple filters such as: city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The resulting webpage is a success! We are able to filter to multiple data points.  Anyone that visits the page can filter through the date, city, state, country, and shape.  All one has to do is enter the date, city state, country, and shape they would like to observe.  Not all of the fields need to have an input.  One can filter through with just the date and city, city and shape, or state, country, and date.  Any combination will work as long as the spelling is correct, and the particular date, city, state, country, and shape have data for those criteria iin question.

Here are a few examples of searched criteria:

    Searched for date: 1/9/2010 and state: ca

    Searched for state: ks and shape: circle

    Searched for state: or and shape: triangle

## Summary 

Although the page is running efficently, there are a few draw backs.  The different searchable criteria needs to be spelled correctly according to the info on the page.  Casing is also a must.  I have tried seraching for AR versus ar.  Nothing comes up for AR, but I get many results for ar.  Not all 50 states are accounted for, so many states will no bring up any information.  The user using the page, would have to look through the data, the narrow down what they want to filter.  Rather than blindly typing in any information to search.

Two things to make this a better webpage:

1. Inclusion of more data from different years instead of just the 2010.
2. If there was a picture associated with the sighting, this would be somehting nice to show the user.
